# Sudoku-Generator

A collection of increasingly more efficient algorithms for generating & solving sudoku puzzles.

Sudoku-Generator is a fun project I started during my third year of uni to get better at Python (and cause I love writing algorithms to solve problems). I have kept each of the different solving algorithms in the project so others who are curious can learn from them. Currently, the project is incomplete, and hence there will be several bugs, but I'm quickly working towards solving those.

## New Algorithms / Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. As with all my projects, I am constantly on the lookout to add to the collection of algorithms, especially if they outperform all the others. If you know of an algorithm then I'd love to hear from you, and if you want to have a go at improving my work then by all means do so, I'd love to learn how I can do better with performance, design patterns, and more.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
